# Simple To-Do (localStorage)

Files:
- index.html — main UI
- styles.css — mobile-first styling
- app.js — JavaScript with localStorage persistence (key: todo.tasks.v1)

Open index.html in a browser to use. Tasks persist between reloads. You can export and import tasks via JSON.

Notes:
- No backend required.
- Keeps things intentionally simple and accessible for quick internal use.
- If you want a React version, sync across devices, or encryption, tell me which direction and I’ll add it.
